# EVO - Intelligent Voice Assistant

A final year project developed at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus, that revolutionizes how users interact with their Android devices through natural language processing and intelligent automation.

## 🌟 Overview

EVO is designed to simplify complex mobile interfaces by providing a natural language-driven assistant that understands user intent and automates tasks across various applications. Instead of navigating through multiple menus and applications, users can simply express their needs in natural language.

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Intent recognition and entity extraction
  - Context-aware automation
  - Multi-language support (English & Urdu)

- **Task Automation**
  - Email composition and summarization
  - Calendar management
  - Meeting scheduling
  - Reminder settings
  - Cross-application task execution

- **Smart Integration**
  - Calendar synchronization
  - Email integration
  - WhatsApp messaging
  - Alarm system integration

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Module Engine**: Core decision-making unit that routes user requests
- **Action Execution**: Handles task implementation across different services
- **Integration Manager**: Manages communication with external applications
- **Data Store**: Secure storage for user preferences and application data
